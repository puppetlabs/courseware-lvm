## The Learning Virtual Machine (VM)

If you want to learn more about Puppet or are a new user of Puppet or just looking to have fun exploring Puppet, then you've come to the right place. This is our free downloadable Learning VM for you to play around with and explore. The Learning VM is a companion to our Puppet Quests a few sections below, which are a series of tutorials about the Puppet language and using its various tools. Although, please keep in mind that this Learning VM focuses on using Puppet Enterprise at its core, but most of the quests can also apply to Puppet open source.


## Learning Puppet

So what is Puppet? Great question! Puppet is a versatile tool for managing your servers. You simply describe your machine configurations in an easy-to-read declarative language (such as Ruby), and Puppet will ensure that your systems conform to and stay in that desired state.

Associated with this Learning VM are a series of quest adventures that will teach you about about managing your systems with Puppet. These quests start out very basic to accommodate all users no matter your experience level. Essentially, we provide everyone a level starting point to build from. From there, its up to you how much you want to learn and what exactly you want to learn. We hope that this will be the beginning of an interesting journey towards automating your systems management efforts.

## The Quest Structure

The individual quest design is very simple in its structure and consists of three parts.

1. An introduction to the quest as it relates to Puppet
2. A themed storyline of the quest and how Puppet fits in.
3. Going on your quest adventure! (Applying what your knowledge in the Learning VM!)

In the below example quest (you don't need to do anything), in order to understand how Puppet is useful and can be leveraged to simplify configuration management, we will automate a task with Puppet. This is an example quest:

__*Quest*__: 

>Let's assume that you work as an engineer in a web-development firm. You are tasked with configuring Virtual Machines for use by web developers. You are given a list of requirements, such as:  

>* the usernames of the web developers 
* a list of one of more user groups
* a list of files and directories that should be present on the machine  
* a list of software packages that should be installed on the machine 
* a website served by the Apache2 webserver
* a database that should be present on the machine

Each of the above steps are tasks within this quest that you will need to complete.

In the above example you _could_ manually configure the Learning VM by completing a list of tasks each time you need a VM. However, I have a feeling you'll soon realize that this manual process boils down to repeating the same set of tasks over and over again. In addition, you're not even using Puppet, so there really is no point for you to continue.

In relation to this example, we will teach you how to use Puppet to _describe_ your requirements to configure the VM appropriately and automate the process of configuring all the other VM's correctly and quickly.
